# Reverse Image Search Engine  
This is a follow along application built on top of the 4th Chapter of *Practical Deep Learning for Cloud, Mobile & Edge* [1]. The `caltech101` dataset used to train the model can be downloaded at the following [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/137RyRjvTBkBiIfeYBNZBtViDHQ6_Ewsp/view). My attempts to use `curl` and/or `wget` kept resulting in a corrupted tarball that I could not unpack. The code assumes the unpacked files are located in the root folder in a folder titled `caltech101/`.
